    - over come with lots of testing from other people

Problems:
- Difficult to guess what people are going to say

Real problems:
-Can't reassign vars once already set

Todo:
-test bot with test subjects 
    -see how they interact with the bot (4 done)
-gather information about the user talking to the bot
-compline the information and send email to matthew loewen about who's chatting with the bot
