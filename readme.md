Problems so far:
-Getting started took much longer than expected. 
-conversation models are a pain in the butt
-this bot is stupid, doesn't learn
-programming takes a long time 

Real problems:
-Can't reassign vars once already set

Todo:
-test bot with test subjects 
    -see how they interact with the bot
-make conversations with the bot
-gather information about the user talking to the bot
-compline the information and send email to matthew loewen about who's chatting with the bot

Backburner:
Talk to the bot with voice (~10 minutes, already started code)

Completed:
Chat feedback
